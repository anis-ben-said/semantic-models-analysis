            A CSR (Certificate Signing Request) is a 64-based PEM formatted and encrypted message to request and receive a digital certificate. The CSR validates the information required by a specific certification authority (CA) to issue the associated digital certificate.

            The CSR consists of encrypted data, which can include, for example, basic information about the ECU and its manufacturer (common name, company, organizational unit, country, city/town, etc.), information about the public key attached to the certificate, as well as information on the key type and length.

            The value for the subjectSerialNumber is always the same for an ECU and its attached CSRs, but is required to additionally validate each individual CSR.
